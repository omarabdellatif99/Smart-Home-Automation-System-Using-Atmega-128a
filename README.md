# Smart Home Automation System Using Atmega 128a

## Introduction
Welcome to the Smart Home Automation System project repository. This system integrates various sensors and actuators managed by the Atmega 128a microcontroller from the AVR family, creating an intelligent and responsive home environment. This project bridges embedded systems theory with practical application in home automation.

## Features
- **Motion Detection**: Automates lighting and security alerts.
- **Fire Safety**: Employs a flame sensor for early detection and alerts.
- **Adaptive Lighting**: Regulates indoor lighting using a photoresistor.
- **Sound Sensing**: Monitors noise levels.
- **User Interface**: Manual control and feedback via buttons and LEDs.
- **Alert System**: Emergency notifications using buzzers.
