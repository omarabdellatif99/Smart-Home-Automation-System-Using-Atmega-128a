# Smart-Home-Automation-System-Using-Atmega-128a
A hands-on project using Atmega 128a for a smart home setup. Features motion, flame, sound sensors, and photoresistors, integrated with buzzers, LEDs, and buttons. Utilizes GPIO, ADC, timers, and interrupts for responsive automation.
Introduction
Welcome to the Smart Home Automation System project repository. This system is an integration of various sensors and actuators managed by the Atmega 128a microcontroller from the AVR family, designed to create an intelligent and responsive home environment. This project combines embedded systems principles with practical application to offer a hands-on experience in home automation.

Features
Motion Detection: Automates lighting and security alerts through motion sensing.
Fire Safety: Employs a flame sensor for fire detection, triggering alarms and notifications.
Adaptive Lighting: Uses a photoresistor to regulate indoor lighting based on external light levels.
Sound Sensing: Monitors ambient noise, aiding in noise pollution control.
User Interface: Incorporates buttons and LEDs for manual control and system feedback.
Alert System: Utilizes buzzers for emergency notifications and system status alerts.
